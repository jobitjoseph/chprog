# chprog
Here is yet another CH55x programmer with v1 and v2 bootloader detection and support.

This one combines code from other projects: 
* vnproch551: https://github.com/NgoHungCuong/vnproch551
  
  used for v2.3 and v2.4 bootloader support
* libre551: https://github.com/rgwan/librech551
  
  used for v1.0 bootloader support
* added autodetection routine of V1 and V2 bootloaders

  No need to specify bootloader version or protocol - chprog should
  figure it out.

Supported are Write, Verify and Reset for all supported bootloader versions:
1.0, 2.3.1, 2.4.0, 2.5.0

Tested on:
* CH552T, BL: 1.0, 2.3.1, 2.4.0, 2.5.0
* CH551G, BL: 2.3.1

Usage is quite simple:
<pre>
sudo ./chprog firmware.bin
</pre>

Make sure your device is connected to USB port on your PC. The bootloader has to be
activated by pressing the booloader button (or by shorting the bootloader pins/pads)
on your dev board during power-on.

**Win64 port**
Chprog can also also be compiled as a command line tool for Windows 64 bit system.
A precompiled binary is in the 'releases' directory.

IMPORTANT: On Windows you need to install a Libusb driver:
* ensure the official driver from WCH is uninstalled (if you ever used the official tool)
* download 'zadig' from https://zadig.akeo.ie/ and run it
* plug in your CH55x board to usb in bootloader mode
* in zadig, click  Menu->Options->List all devices (must have a check symbol displayed)
* in zadig, select 'USB Module' from the combo box
* select 'WinUSB (v6.1...)' as a driver and click the big Install button
* wait a while - the installation may take few minutes
* unplug and plug-in the CH55x board to your PC
* optionally verify in device manager that the 'USB Module' device is displayed
  in 'USB Serial Bus devices' - not in 'USB Serial Bus controllers'! 


**macOS port**
Chprog can be used on macOS. You need to manually install libusb
driver. The simplest way is using brew, and the `build_macos.sh`expect
libusb to be installed by brew. 

```
brew install libusb
```
